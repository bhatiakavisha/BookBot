 🤖📚 BookBot – Your AI-Powered Book Recommendation Assistant

> “Let’s make discovering books feel like talking to a friend.”

BookBot is an intelligent, mood-aware chatbot that suggests the perfect book based on your feelings, interests, or genre preferences. Built with **IBM Watson Assistant**, it transforms the way readers explore books—through casual, friendly conversation instead of robotic search.
